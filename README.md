# THIS DOCUMENT IS REQUIRED
## Group Info

(what goes here)
Brandon Chao and Abigail Escamilla

## Overview

Our final project is the presentation and implementation of AES-256, a tool used to securely encrypt and decrypt information. Perhaps the most secure algorithm used to hide sensitive information, our group will present and explain how AES works, the functions used within AES, and how secure it is as an algorithm. 

## Instructions

The video will be availible here (insert later). The video will explain all of the information that is availible in the Presentation Markdown file. The implementation of the tool itself is availible as the java file "AES.java" with its own make file. This make file will run the program when inputting the command "make AES". (add to later?)
