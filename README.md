# THIS DOCUMENT IS REQUIRED
## Group Info

Brandon Chao and Abigail Escamilla

## Overview

Our final project is the presentation and implementation of AES-256, a tool used to securely encrypt and decrypt information. Perhaps the most secure algorithm used to hide sensitive information, our group will present and explain how AES works, the functions used within AES, and how secure it is as an algorithm. 

## Instructions

The video will be available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RDACNe1QCrerhUBK7kidZzs5lbjNunVR/view?usp=sharing). The video will explain all of the information that is available in the Presentation Markdown file. The implementation of the tool itself is available as the java file "AES.java" with a provided make file. This make file will run the program when inputting the command "make AES".
