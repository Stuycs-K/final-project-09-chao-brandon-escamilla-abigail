AES or Advanced Encryption Standard is a specification for the encryption of electronic data. 
A variant of the Rjindael cipher, AES is a block cipher that uses a key size of a certain amount of bits to encrypt data. 
Key sizes include: 128, 192, and 256 bits. AES encrypts data in blocks of 128 bits each.
