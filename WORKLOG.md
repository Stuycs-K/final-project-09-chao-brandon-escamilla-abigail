### 5/23/24
  Researching the different modes for AES encryption (including ecb, cbc, cfb, and obc).

### 5/24/24
  Starting to make actual presentation slides and cleaning up notes for AES modes.

### 5/28/24
  Researching how to implement mix columns function and writing pseudocode for the process.

### 5/29/24
  Implemented mixColumns and expanded on possible topics for presentation, such as the security of AES.

### 6/03/24
  Researched and organized topics for presentation. Discussed with other AES groups what topics we are each focusing on.

### 6/05/24
  Moved presentation info into the markdown file and edited it for markdown format. Began more research on attacks on AES.

### 6/07/24
  Added and rewrote notes about modes for presentation.

### 6/08/24
  Added info about constants, keys, and rounds to the presentation. Reviewed the new AES code to try and help figure out the problem with key exchange.

## Brandon Chao

### 5/22/24
  Added to the research documented in notes.txt on AES, particularly the main functions and modes of AES.

### 5/23/24
  Added to the AES java implementation, starting with subBytes and addRoundKey.

### 5/24/24
  Researched KeyExpansion/AES Key Schedule and Mix Columns.

### 5/28/24
